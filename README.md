# **Hospital Backend System – Final Implementation**  

## **Overview**  

The **Hospital Backend System** has been successfully developed to streamline user management, patient–doctor assignments, doctor note submissions, and dynamic scheduling of actionable steps based on live LLM processing. The system ensures robust security by encrypting sensitive data and leverages a live LLM to extract actionable steps from doctor notes. These steps are categorized into a **Checklist** (immediate tasks) and a **Plan** (scheduled actions). Additionally, any new note submissions automatically override previously scheduled tasks to maintain up-to-date treatment plans.  

## **Features and Implementation**  

### **1. User Management**  

- **Signup & Authentication**  
  - Users can register as either a **Patient** or a **Doctor**, providing their **Name, Email, and Password**.  
  - The authentication system ensures secure access using **JWT-based authentication**.  
  - **Passwords are securely hashed**, and **patient notes are encrypted**, ensuring only the assigned doctor and the patient can view raw notes.  

### **2. Patient–Doctor Assignment**  

- After signing up, **patients can select from a list of available doctors**.  
- **Doctors have access to a personalized dashboard** displaying all the patients who have chosen them.  

### **3. Doctor Notes & Actionable Steps**  

- **Doctor Note Submission**  
  - Doctors can submit medical notes for their assigned patients.  
- **LLM Integration for Actionable Steps**  
  - Submitted notes are processed by a **live LLM (e.g., Google Gemini Flash)** to extract **actionable steps**:
    - **Checklist**: Immediate one-time tasks (e.g., "Buy Drug A").  
    - **Plan**: Scheduled actions (e.g., "Take Drug A daily for 7 days").  
- **Dynamic Scheduling System**  
  - Scheduled reminders are **automatically created** based on the treatment plan.  
  - If a patient **misses a check-in**, the system **extends the reminder duration** accordingly.  
  - Any **new note submissions override previously scheduled tasks** to ensure accuracy in treatment plans.  

### **4. API Endpoints**  

The system exposes the following **fully functional API endpoints**:  

- **User Management**  
  - `POST /api/signup/` – Register users (Patients or Doctors).  
  - `POST /api/login/` – Authenticate users.  

- **Patient–Doctor Assignment**  
  - `POST /api/select-doctor/` – Patients select a doctor.  
  - `GET /api/doctor/patients/` – Doctors retrieve their assigned patients.  

- **Doctor Notes & Actionable Steps**  
  - `POST /api/submit-notes/` – Doctors submit patient notes.  
  - `GET /api/actionable-steps/` – Retrieve generated checklist and plan for a patient.  

- **Reminders & Scheduling**  
  - `GET /api/reminders/` – Fetch scheduled reminders for a patient.  

## **Security & Encryption**  

- **End-to-end encryption** ensures **patient notes remain private**, viewable only by the assigned doctor and the patient.  
- **Role-based authentication** prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data.  
- **Secure storage mechanisms** have been implemented for user credentials and LLM-generated tasks.  

## **Conclusion**  

This **Hospital Backend System** is now fully operational, providing a **secure and efficient** workflow for hospitals. It integrates **advanced encryption, dynamic scheduling, and LLM processing** to enhance doctor-patient interactions while maintaining strict security and privacy standards.
